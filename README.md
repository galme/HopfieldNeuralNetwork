# HopfieldNeuralNetwork
Hopfield Neural Network implementation using Hebb and Storkey learning rule

Uses:
 * C++
 * Qt 4.1.0
 * <a href="http://arma.sourceforge.net/">Armadillo lib</a> 7.960 for (non-working) pseudo-inverse rule
 
The program is hardcoded to use Storkey learning (because it worked best in my tests), but code for the Hebb rule is also there. General pseudo-inverse learning rule code is also present, but not functional in practise yet.
An option to pick the size of the NN is also there.
